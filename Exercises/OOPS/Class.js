//  Class is a data type that acts as a blue print or template

// it contains properties and methods

// we can access the methods and properties using member variables

        console.log("Your balance is: 500");
    }

    openAccount() {
        console.log(this.depositAmount += this.minBalance)

console.log(E1);


// to refer inside the class "this" keyword is used

// to refer outside the class the objects are used

// -------------------------------------------------------
// constructor will execute automatically when objects are created

// it is special method

// we can't invoke constructor explicitly

OOPS Features

-> Abstraction
-> Encapsulation
-> Inheritance                       
  

-> Polymorphism


Inheritance 

reusing a existing feature or a property/method

adding new functionality 

it even inherits the constructor methods as well

this can be achieved using extends keyword in javascript

we can reuse as many times as we want

we can override the methods also 



Tasks : please try an example using extends keyword

if we did not have a constructor in class, it has default c"
